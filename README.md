o3ServerManagement is a graphical Python application that allows you to create backups and monitor important metadata of the system. 
It is simple in structure and shines in a beautiful XP design.


Versions:
Alpha 1.0 is only available in German.
The Beta 1.0 version is also planned to be available in English.


Functions:
The application has a control panel that displays basic metadata on, for example, the network, hard drives and CPU as well as RAM.
There is also the backup platform that makes it possible to make backups of files.
Then there is a terminal that is intended to use the functions just mentioned completely via terminal, for example, retrieving backups and metadata.


Areas of application:
The application is best suited for use on Windows systems. Tested under Windows Server 2019 - works great.
The application also works under Linux, tested under Debian 12, but when running under Linux certain functions 
may only work poorly or not at all, this is because this application is primarily developed for use on Windows server systems.

  
have fun
